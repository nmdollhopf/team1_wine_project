# team1_wine_project
Final Project of Wine Classification for the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp


Define the columns and the data inside them. 


This dataset contains twelve columns that we will take data from and analyze:

-Fixed Acidity: This columm contains data on most of the acids that are involved with wine. 

-Volatile Acidity: This is data on the amount of acetic acid found in wine. If the amount is too high it can negatively impact the taste of the wine, giving it a more vinegar taste. 

-Citric Acid: This is typically found in smaller quantities. It has an effect on the percieved 'freshness' of the wine and its overall flavor. 

-Residual Sugar: This is the measure of the amount of sugar that is retained after the wine fermentation process is complete. The wines will naturally be sweeter the more sugar is retained after fermentation. 

-Chlorides: The is the measure of the salt content in the wine. 

-Free Sulfur Dioxide: Without getting into too much detail about the chemical processes involved, this is the 'free form' of So2 and exists in the wine to oxidize it and prevent microbial growth. 

-Total Sulfur Dioxide: This includes the 'free form' and 'bound form' of So2. This has an impact on smell and taste of the wine at higher concentrations. 

-Density: The density of water content in the wine. The amount varies depending on how much alcohol and sugar is present. 

-pH: The pH column in this dataset is measuring the overall acidity of the wine. The pH scale starts at 0 up to 14, the lower the number the more acidic it is. Most wines are around 3-4 on the pH scale.
