# Initial website for displaying graphs for Wine Quality anlaysis

## List of Graphs

### Distributions of data set (raw data or infamily data)

   -Distributions of physiochemical properties of red wine

   -Distributions of physiochemical propertoes of white wine

### Unsupervised learning model-K-means (prediction of red or white wine based on physiochemical properties) secondary analysis

#### Selected scatterplots of physiochemical properites showing clear separation of red vs white wines

    -scatter plot #1 
    -scatter plot #2
    -scatter plot #3

#### Accuracy Scores

    -unsupervised Kmeans confusion matrix

### Supervised learning model (prediction of quality of wine  based on physiochemical properties) primary analysis

#### logit model; Quality binned into (5) outcomes 3-4,5,6,7,8-9 (note red wine does not have 9)

    -confusion matrix for red wine 
    -confusion matrix for white wine 
    

#### SVC model; Quality binned into (3) outcomes 3-4, 5-7, 8-9 (note red wine does not have 9)

    -confusion matrix for red wine
    -confusion matrix for white wine 
   

### Optimized SVC model; Quality binned into (2-binary) outcomes 3-5, 6-9 (note red wine does not have 9)- confirm split

    -confusion matrix for red wine (image pending)
    -confusion matrix for white wine (image pending)
    -confusion matrix for combined white and red wine (image pending)
